    Takes a SPrime score output file as input and returns a bed file (or a dataframe) with introgressed tracts per individual / haplotype.

    Parameters
    ----------
    score_file : str, Filepath to the SPrime output file
    vcf_file: str, filepath to the vcf-file which was used as input for SPrime
    out_file : (optional) str, filepath for writing the bed-file with the introgressed tracts per individual; if None, no output file is written and the dataframe is returned
    target_indivdiuals: list, indicating the individuals in the target panel, i.e. for which introgressed fragments shouls be detected (has to correspond to the ids in the vcf_file)
    segment_fraction: (optional) float, if specified, indicates the minimum fraction of SNPs in the target which correspond to the SNPs in the segment provided by SPrime so that it is marked as introgressed in this individual
    min_snps: (optional) int: within a segment, the minimum number of adjacent SNPs so that this region of a segment is marked as introgressed in the specific individual
    phased: (bool) if phased, the inidividual names in the final bed-file are suffixed by '_1' for the first haplotype, '_2' for the second haplotype; if not phased, tracts for both haplotypes are merged. Currently only diploid input is supported. Since SPrime takes diploid phased data as input, one usually will use Phased=True,
    default: True
    merge_distance: (optional) int, for the final merging of tracts, an int > 0 indicates that also regions with a gap should be merged in case that the distance is smaller than merge_distance in base pairs. Can also (preferably) done in a later step.
    default: 0
    only_tract_output: (optional) True, in case of false, an extra column with 'haplotype' is generated in the bedfile, otherwise the individual names are suffixed as described in phased and no extra haplotype-column is generated
    default: True
    return_full_records: (optional) False: instead of returning the bed-file, a larger dataframe with the number of snps and the segment fraction for each intrgressed region is returned. Overwrites only_tract_output.
